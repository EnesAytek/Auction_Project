# DJANGO/Auction_Project
# This is an auction project.
# In the project, the admin can add the products he wants by setting the starting price and setting the bidding price.
# Users who are not logged in can view auctions but can not bid.
# When logged in users place bids, they can view these items on the 'my-auctions' page.
# The highest bidder in an auction can view these products on the 'my-last-bids'page.
